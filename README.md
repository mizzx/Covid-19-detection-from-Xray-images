# Covid-19-detection-from-Xray-images
3 classes of chest X-ray images (Normal, Covid-19, TB) ---  300 samples each

Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used as feature extractor, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception. 
Three machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used as classifier for the features extracted.

Transfer learning of the CNN models, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception were used as classifier for comparison methods.
